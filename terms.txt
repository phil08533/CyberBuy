3.2. Users report sporadic auditory hallucinations, sudden latency in neural responses, and unexplainable thought looping.  
3.3. CyberBuy is not responsible for altered moral reasoning, emergent personalities, or perceived digital consciousness.

4. LIABILITY
4.1. By purchasing or activating implants, users waive the right to pursue legal action regarding neural malfunction, data leakage, or identity dissonance.

7.1. Users acknowledge that augmentation may lead to a new hierarchy of cognition and physical capability.  
7.2. Users accept that all enhancements are experimental and may outpace natural human evolution.

9. GOVERNING LAW
9.1. These terms are governed by the Intercontinental Cybernetic Accord of 2082 and subject to Neural Arbitration Protocols.  
9.2. Disputes arising from the use of implants, services, or cognitive enhancements are considered outside standard human legal jurisdiction.  

BY CLICKING “I ACCEPT,” OR BY INSTALLING, ACTIVATING, OR USING ANY CYBERBUY IMPLANT, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS. NON-COMPLIANCE MAY RESULT IN UNRETRIEVABLE LOSS OF NEURAL FUNCTION, IDENTITY FRAGMENTATION, OR PERMANENT COGNITIVE ALTERATION.
