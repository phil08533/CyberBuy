<h1>X220 Energy Modulator – Jittered Neurons?</h1>
<p class="thread-meta">Posted by Operator_42 • 2 hours ago</p>

<p>I’ve been running the X220 for about 3 weeks. Energy levels are insane, but I’m starting to forget names and sometimes hear static when I’m tired.</p>

<p>Anyone else experiencing this?</p>
